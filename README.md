4. Set up MySQL database in XAMPP and update database configurations in `settings.py`.
 ## Database Configuration

In `settings.py`, update the `DATABASES` section with your MySQL configuration:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'your_database_name',
        'USER': 'your_database_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_database_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '3306',
    }
}
